Project: NASA Space Explorer App (JSON Edition)

NASA publishes an Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)—images and videos with short explanations about our universe.

In this project, you’ll build a gallery that fetches APOD-style entries from a provided JSON feed (same field names as the real APOD API). Render a grid of items and a modal with details.
